# weather-page

## Description

My motivation for this project was to do my best with the resouces I had, I was unfortunate with my tutoring session not being available with no reason given. Reason I built this webpage was to create a visible weather for current day and forecast the next five day weather condition. The problem it solves is that those who don't have access to television but do have access to internet can see the weather if wanted. I learned a lot about how to set up the fetch on JavaScript.
